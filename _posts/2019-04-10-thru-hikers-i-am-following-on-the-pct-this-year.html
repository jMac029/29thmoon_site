excerpt: wanderers to follow along with on their epic journey
---
<p>I first learned about the PCT back when I was in the Boy Scouts and was first getting into backpacking, ever since then I have dreamt of one day taking up that adventure. Although I don't currently have the freedom to take 5 months away from my family and work to do a thru-hike I like to romanticize about it by following thru-hikers on their journeys on the Pacific Crest Trail. Maybe one day I will have the time to do it in sections. Every spring I find a few thru-hikers to follow on Instagram and take part in their epic journey from northbound from Mexico to Canada. Here are some of the hikers I am following this year:</p>

<p>This dude is hiking to loose 200 pounds, he's taking it slow and steady. He has a great heart and everyone is cheering him on. He came up on the #pct2019 feed way back in January, he was probably the first person to hit the trail this year. He post update videos on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/secondchancehiker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">youtube channel</a> you can follow along.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/pct_amputee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pct_amputee</a></p>
<p>She's on a mission to be the first amputee to complete a thru-hike of the PCT! It's awesome to watch her accomplish this goal, she's had a few close calls along the way so far but she's got a great attitude and has taken some great pics along the way. I am looking forward to cheering her on her quest.</p>

<p>Every year I find a photographer I like who is taking some awesome shots. This Guy, Kevin is the one of those great photographers to follow along this year. He bounced ahead to skip some of the early heavy snow but now he is into the thick of it.</p>

<p>For now that's who I have been following directly so far. It is good to follow the hashtag of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/pct2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#pct2019</a> to keep up with all the hikers as they share their adventure with the world and take up the task of following the long and winding path of 2,650miles along the Pacific Crest Trail. I am sure there will be more to follow as more and more hikers hit the trail this spring and later in the summer there will be some southbound hikers to follow as well.</p>
<p>Who are you following this year? Have you hiked the PCT? or dream of one day hiking it? Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.</p>
