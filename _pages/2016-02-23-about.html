<p style="text-align:center;">I've built this site to document my wanderings whether that be in nature, learning new skills or the greatest journey that we are all on "life." I primarily write and share about hiking, backpacking, technology, learning and my life.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I am a DevOps Engineer by trade working primarily with cloud technologies. I am also an amateur photography in landscapes and candid people photos, my favorite subjects are sweeping vistas and my family. I hope you enjoy what I share with you and feel free to comment on any of my post, would love to hear and interact with you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Here are some featured post where I share more about myself.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I'll have more to add to this soon.</p>
